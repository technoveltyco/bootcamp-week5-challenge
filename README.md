## Overview

This weekâ€™s Challenge requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected.

### The challenge

This weekâ€™s challenge requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If youâ€™re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## My process

First, I went through a design phase of the data flow, pseudocode, and modelling the activity and sequence diagrams of the application in UML.

You can check further details about the application design details at the [software design document](./assets/../docs/software-design.md).

### Built with

- [UML 2.5.1](https://www.omg.org/spec/UML)
- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
